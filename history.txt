HISTORY

The general idea was taken from the need to capture snapshots of data on
a regular basis and have easy access to that data.  Originally, the script
handled alerting as well but I've since recognized the sense in offloading
the alerting to a separate system.

Quite simply this script is a front-end for rsync which does the real work.
This script just creates the environment and manages the rotation of
archives.
